# Changelog for polysemy-plugin

## 0.2.5.2 (2020-11-01)

- Fixed crashes stemming from unused optimization passes
  ([#382](https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy/pull/382))

## 0.2.5.1 (2020-09-15)

- The plugin now works on GHC 8.10 (thanks to @googleson78)

## 0.2.5.0 (2020-02-14)

- Updated the lower bounds to `polysemy-1.3.0.0` because of changes to
    `polysemy` internals

## 0.2.4.0 (2019-10-29)

- The plugin now works on GHC 8.8.1 (thanks to @googleson78 and @sevanspowell)
- Improved error messages for when you forgot to include `polysemy` itself

## 0.2.3.0 (2019-09-04)

- The plugin will now choose between given effects based on the ability to unify them.
    This makes it possible for disambiguation to kick in even when using multiple
    instances of the same effect with different type variables,
    as long as type annotations/applications are used to
    target a specific instance.
- Updated the test suite to test against `polysemy-1.2.0.0`.

    messages
- Updated the lower bounds to `polysemy-0.6.0.0`

## 0.2.1.1 (2019-06-26)

- Greatly improved the plugin's ability to unify polymorphic types when running
    interpreters.

## 0.2.0.3 (2019-06-13)

- Fixed a bug where the plugin could (incorrectly) loop indefinitely attempting
    to solve some constraints.

    successfully run the test-suite.

## 0.2.0.2 (2019-06-09)

- Updated the test suite to test against `polysemy-0.3`

    `polysemy`'s `inlineRecursiveCalls` when run with `-O`
